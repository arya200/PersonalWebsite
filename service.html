                                       A couple of years ago, I was part of a project set up by <a href = "https://habitatindia.org/">Habitat for Humanity</a> in Karjat, India.
                                       A few weeks before we arrived the farming village had been a victim of a vicious hurricane that destroyed their walls, roofs and agriculture.
                                       We spent 2 days in the village working on various landscaping and construction projects.
                                       My team and I and set up an exterior wall for the village, as well as built a roof for many of the houses.
                                       It was an amazing experience to be able to give back to the farmers that contribute to the country everyday.<br><br><br>

                                        Every since I was a child I have always seen people begging on the road in my city. 
                                        Most of them children, simply trying to find enough money to survive through the day.
                                        Under a flyover close to where my friends and I live, we saw this family with a lot of kids selling various items on the street.
                                        We approached their parents and asked if they would be alright with us teaching their children English, and they wholeheartedly agreed!
                                        Thus began our 6 month long project of teaching children from the ages of 5-20 vocational English.
                                        The project was a success for the time that we had, but unfortunately due to government regulations, the family was forced to relocate and we were unable to continue teaching them.<br><br>
                                        It was amazing to experience teaching English, and realisng how different people can be when they are speaking in their native language, versus a language they are unfamilliar with.
                                        Teaching children is always difficult, especially those that have gone through so much hardship. 
                                        Although, the ability to emphatize and connect with people regardless of socio economic backgrounds is what helped me teach these children succesfully.
                                        The above video is a happy birthday message, my friends and students made for me which is very close to my heart.
